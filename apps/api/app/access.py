"""Pure RBAC rules, kept strictly separate from authentication.

Authentication answers "who are you?" (see ``app.dev_auth`` for the local
dev-only adapter). This module only answers "what is this role allowed to
do?" for one product grant at a time. A caller with no grant for a product
must always be denied, never fall through to a default allow.
