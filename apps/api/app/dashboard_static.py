"""Serve a built product dashboard from the same-origin FastAPI service.

A production container packages one FastAPI process together with one
product's React production build, so there is no separate frontend origin
and no CORS surface to secure (see ``docs/platform/production-platform-v1.md``
and the Dockerfile at the repo root). Local development is unaffected: every
dashboard normally runs via its own Vite dev server (see e.g.
``products/transelect/dashboard/README.md``), and this module is a no-op
whenever no built ``dist/`` directory is present — which is always true in
local dev and in CI/test, since ``dist/`` is gitignored and only produced by
``npm run build``.
