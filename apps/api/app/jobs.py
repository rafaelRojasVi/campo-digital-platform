"""Durable PostgreSQL-backed job queue.

No message broker. Concurrency safety comes entirely from
``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``: two workers racing to claim the same
row never succeed at the same row, because the losing worker's subquery
simply skips a row already locked by the other worker's transaction and
finds nothing (or the next available row) instead.
