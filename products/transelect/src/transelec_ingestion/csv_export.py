"""TR-FUNC-037's CSV export: field set (TR-OPEN-04) and formula-injection hardening.

**Corrected from an earlier draft of this module.** TR-OPEN-04's field set
was originally a best-effort guess because neither ratified document
enumerated the literal field names. The source forensic audit now records
the exact, ordered field list confirmed by direct read of `exportCSV()` in
both source HTML files (see that document's "Exact field list, confirmed by
direct read" notes under the v0 and Actualizable sections). Actualizable's
order (the more recent, more-used file, and the one whose KPI set this
task already implements) is:

``PMF, Predio Ref, Carpeta, PAS, Estado resumido, Tipo de rechazo, Tipo de
propietario, Rol, N Predio, N Area de Corta, Superficie de corta, Fecha de
ingreso, N Ingreso, Empresa, ID_Predo_Unico, Sector, Observación auxiliar``

``EXPORT_FIELDS_V1`` below reproduces that order with two settled
adjustments (not re-derived here — the corrected audit doc already decided
both):

1. **``Carpeta`` is split into its two positionally-distinct source
   fields**, ``carpeta_source`` (column E) and ``carpeta_normalizada``
   (column AC), each its own labeled column — Actualizable's single
   ``Carpeta`` export value has *ambiguous* provenance (a JS object-key
   collision silently picks one of the two source columns, and which one
   was never independently confirmed), so exporting both, positionally,
   is more faithful than guessing which one Javier's export happens to
   keep.
2. **``Observación auxiliar`` ships as an always-empty reserved column.**
   The audit confirms this field is sourced from the ``Pendientes`` sheet
   (per the source HTML's own footer text), not from any ``Resumen`` A:AD
   field — populating it would require exactly the auxiliary-sheet
   auto-merge this design's non-goals rule out for V1
   (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-transelec-hosted-pilot-v2-design.md`,
   "No automatic merge of historical `Resumen` sheets, `Pendientes`,
   `Reingresos`, or `Urgentes 07May` into current state"). The column is
   kept for structural familiarity with what Javier is used to opening,
   deliberately unmapped to any `transelec_resumen_row` column so it
   always renders blank.

Net result: **18 columns, not a literal 17** — the corrected matrix's
TR-FUNC-037 row documents why. This is still a single named constant, so a
future correction (e.g. Javier confirming a preference between the two
``Carpeta`` columns) is a one-place change.

CSV formula-injection hardening is a **separate, mandatory, security**
requirement, independent of the field-set question above: any cell value
beginning with ``=``, ``+``, ``-``, or ``@`` is prefixed with a single quote
before being written, so it can never be interpreted as a live formula by
Excel/LibreOffice/Google Sheets on open ("CSV injection" / "formula
injection"). This is a deliberate, security-motivated divergence from
Javier's raw CSV export (neither HTML file does this), applied uniformly to
every cell regardless of source type — including a legitimate negative
number, which is the accepted, documented trade-off of this class of
mitigation (see OWASP's CSV Injection guidance): a stray ``'`` prefix on a
negative surface value is a much smaller cost than a live formula executing
in a stakeholder's spreadsheet.
