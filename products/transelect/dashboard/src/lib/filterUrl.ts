/**
 * The filter state, carried in the URL.
 *
 * TR-FUNC-017 requires every section to agree about what "the current view"
 * means. The shipped application achieved that by fetching all five read
 * endpoints together inside one component. That still holds — see
 * `useDashboardData` — but it could only ever hold *within* one page: opening
 * a second section dropped the filters, and a filtered view could not be
 * linked, bookmarked or reloaded.
 *
 * Putting the state in the query string fixes all three, and makes the
 * guarantee observable: the parameters in the address bar are produced by the
 * same `filterParams` serializer the API client sends, so a reader can
 * compare the URL against the network request and see they match.
 *
 * The parameter names are the API's own contract, unchanged. This module
 * only reads and writes them.
