# External tooling inventory

This repo vendors no third-party source. Everything below is an external
reference (package/binary/library), installed via official channels only.

## CLI/headless tools (WSL2 host)

### PDAL

#### Validated local setup

PDAL is installed and operational on the current WSL2 development host.
The host is Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (`noble`). The configured APT sources do
not currently expose `pdal` or `libpdal-dev`, so PDAL is kept outside the
project's `uv` environment in a dedicated Micromamba environment.

Validated versions on 2026-08-18:

- Micromamba: `2.9.0`
- environment: `pdal-cli`
- PDAL: `2.10.2` (`git-version: e8618b`)
- PDAL executable: `/home/rafael/micromamba/envs/pdal-cli/bin/pdal`
- project Python remains managed independently by `uv` / `.venv`

Micromamba itself is installed at `~/.local/bin/micromamba`, with root
prefix `~/micromamba`, and shell initialization is recorded in `~/.zshrc`.

Installation used:

```bash
# Run outside the project's activated Python .venv.
deactivate  # if the project .venv is active

"${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)
source ~/.zshrc

micromamba create -y \
  -n pdal-cli \
  -c conda-forge \
  pdal

micromamba activate pdal-cli
```

For later shells:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
micromamba activate pdal-cli
cd /home/rafael/dev/freelance/campo-digital-platform
```

The repository deliberately uses the PDAL **CLI** boundary:
`src/lidar_io/pdal_wrapper.py` shells out to `pdal` via `subprocess` and
checks `shutil.which("pdal")`. This keeps the project's Python 3.12 `uv`
environment independent from PDAL's native dependency stack.

Note: the Conda Forge transaction selected a Python runtime and
`python-pdal` inside the isolated `pdal-cli` environment as package
dependencies. The application does not import or depend on those bindings;
they are not part of the project's `.venv` or `pyproject.toml` contract.

#### Validation

The installation was validated from the repository root with:

```bash
which pdal
pdal --version
pdal --drivers | head -40
uv run pytest tests/test_pdal_pipelines.py -v
uv run pytest
```

Observed result:

```text
PDAL 2.10.2
8/8 PDAL pipeline tests passed
33/33 repository tests passed
0 skipped
```

This proves the repo's PDAL JSON pipeline templates are accepted by the
installed PDAL CLI and that the previously skipped PDAL tests execute
successfully when the `pdal-cli` Micromamba environment is active.

#### Known optional-plugin warning

`pdal --drivers` currently emits load errors for these optional plugins:

- `libpdal_plugin_reader_hdf.so`
- `libpdal_plugin_reader_icebridge.so`

Both report a missing `libhdf5_cpp.so.320` shared library. Core PDAL is
still operational and all repository PDAL tests pass. Treat this as an
explicit environment caveat rather than evidence that the installation is
fully warning-free. Do not depend on the HDF or IceBridge readers until
that native-library mismatch is resolved and revalidated.

No CUDA-specific PDAL functionality is currently required by this PoC.
The large Conda environment and CUDA-related packages selected by the
solver are implementation details of this isolated external runtime, not
project runtime requirements.

### LAStools / LASlib / LASzip

- Status on this host: **not installed**. `which lasinfo` found nothing.
- LASzip (the compression library PDAL/laspy's `lazrs`/`laszip` backends
  use) and LASlib are open-source (LGPL); the full **LAStools** CLI suite
  bundles both free tools and separately-licensed commercial tools
  (e.g. `lasground`, `lasclassify` in unlicensed mode are demo/watermarked
  or restricted). Do not install commercially-licensed LAStools components
  without Campo Digital's/your own license.
- Free/open components: obtain via https://github.com/LASzip/LASzip and
  https://rapidlasso.de/downloads/ (LAStools free/open subset).
- We rely on `laspy[lazrs]` (pure Python + Rust LAZ codec) for LAS/LAZ I/O
  in this repo instead of requiring LAStools at all.

## GUI tools -- Windows host

WSL2 remains the CLI/headless development environment. GUI point-cloud/GIS
tools run on the Windows host and can open ignored files under the WSL
filesystem through the WSL network share.

### CloudCompare

CloudCompare is installed and validated on the Windows host.

Validated on 2026-08-18:

- version: `v2.14.beta` (`Aug 16 2026`, 64-bit)
- executable: `C:\Program Files\CloudCompare\CloudCompare.exe`
- renderer observed: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080
- OpenGL: 4.6 / GLSL 4.60
- LAS I/O plugin loaded successfully
- a real ~330 MB / 9.7M-point LAS opened successfully from the WSL network
  path in about 8.366 seconds

Find the executable from WSL:

```bash
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command \
  "Get-ChildItem 'C:\Program Files','C:\Program Files (x86)' -Filter CloudCompare.exe -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 5 -ExpandProperty FullName"
```

Launch it from WSL:

```bash
"/mnt/c/Program Files/CloudCompare/CloudCompare.exe"
```

Open a WSL-hosted LAS from the terminal:

```bash
LAS="$(realpath data/raw/v01_MG_23jun2026/v01_MG_23jun2026.las)"
WIN_LAS="$(wslpath -w "$LAS")"
"/mnt/c/Program Files/CloudCompare/CloudCompare.exe" "$WIN_LAS"
```

For the first real dataset, CloudCompare automatically applied a display
re-centering translation:

```text
(-499995.00 ; 4166584.00 ; 0.00)
```

This is required for numerical/display precision with large coordinates and
must not be confused with changing the source coordinate system or permanently
transforming the LAS. Do not overwrite the private source LAS after interactive
CloudCompare operations.

See `docs/datasets/v01_MG_23jun2026.md` for the corresponding real-data
forensic baseline.

### QGIS

- Status: **not installed yet** on the Windows host.
- Intended use: CRS/GIS validation and spatial context after the source CRS is
  established.

`COPC` (cloud-optimized point cloud) is a **format spec**, not a library
here -- referenced for future use: https://copc.io/

open3d/pyvista are kept in an optional `geometry-extra` extra rather than
the base dependency set: see the architecture/dependency notes for why
(they are heavy binary wheels not needed for the currently-implemented
numpy-only geometry ops).
