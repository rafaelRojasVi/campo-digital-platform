# Campo Digital Production Platform V1

## Status

Production target: **Proposed**.

Local persistence foundation: **Implemented (2026-08-27)**.

This document defines the current target production architecture for Campo
Digital. Managed production infrastructure has not yet been provisioned.

Provider pricing and comparative research are non-canonical and live under
`docs/research/`.

## Objective

Campo Digital needs a maintainable production platform for three separate
bounded product contexts:

1. LiDAR / Cubicación
2. Gestión Predial Forestal / QGIS
3. Transelec

The platform must centralize application state without turning individual
computers, OneDrive, generated HTML files, or spreadsheets into the production
database.

## Core principles

- OneDrive remains a collaboration and external source system.
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS becomes the canonical structured/geospatial store.
- Large and original binary source assets belong in object storage.
- Imported source versions remain auditable.
- Product business logic remains isolated by bounded context.
- The backend remains a modular monolith until concrete requirements justify
  further service separation.
- Long-running processing is separated from normal HTTP request handling.
- Managed infrastructure is preferred over self-managed servers when it
  materially reduces operational burden.
- A stakeholder or developer laptop is never the production source of truth.

## Current preferred production provider

The current preferred V1 candidate is Google Cloud Platform in the Santiago
region.

Proposed managed components:

- Cloud Run for the FastAPI application;
- Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL with PostGIS;
- Cloud Storage for private source assets and generated artifacts;
- Cloud Run Jobs for ingestion and long-running processing;
- Cloud Scheduler when scheduled execution becomes necessary;
- Secret Manager for production credentials;
- Cloud Monitoring / Logging for operational visibility;
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

This provider decision remains **Proposed** until the infrastructure ADR is
accepted and the cost/operational assumptions are reviewed.

## Database strategy

Start with one managed PostgreSQL/PostGIS instance.

Do not create independent database servers for LiDAR, Forestry, and Transelec
without an operational reason.

Logical ownership must nevertheless remain explicit:

```text
platform
forestry
transelec
lidar
```

The first Git-tracked migration now ensures PostGIS and establishes an empty
`platform` schema. Product schemas and business tables remain unimplemented
until their domain requirements are established.

### Interim placement: Transelec hosted-pilot tables

The Transelec hosted pilot's two snapshot tables
(`platform.transelec_workbook_snapshot`, `platform.transelec_dashboard_state`,
migration `0003`) live under the shared `platform` schema with a
`transelec_` prefix, not under a dedicated `transelec` schema as the logical
ownership list above implies. This is a deliberate interim pilot placement,
not the target state:

- one PostgreSQL/PostGIS instance is used, per the database strategy above;
- shared cross-product source provenance (`platform.source_*`) stays
  `platform`-owned, as intended;
- workbook bytes stay outside PostgreSQL entirely, in object storage (see
  Object-storage strategy below) — only metadata and a storage key live in
  these tables;
- a dedicated `transelec` schema and canonical Transelec product tables
  (confirmed predio/area identity, business status modeling, and so on)
  remain deferred until Javier's real workflow and the Transelec domain
  model are confirmed. Today there is no canonical Transelec data model to
  schema-scope — only a validated source-row projection of the `Resumen`
  worksheet.

This placement is not precedent for putting future Transelec business
tables in `platform`. Once a real domain model exists, it belongs in a
dedicated `transelec` schema per the logical ownership list above.

## Object-storage strategy

PostgreSQL must not contain large LAS/LAZ files, source ZIP archives, workbook
binaries, imagery, or generated export packages.

Object storage will hold:

- immutable source snapshots;
- LAS/LAZ;
- Shapefile/GeoPackage packages;
- Excel workbooks;
- images;
- PDFs;
- generated HTML;
- reports;
- generated GIS exports.

The database stores metadata, provenance, current state, processing state, and
references to these objects.

## Application execution

Normal HTTP operations remain in FastAPI.

Long-running or resource-intensive work must execute outside the request
lifecycle.

Examples include:

- LiDAR processing;
- large GIS conversion;
- ingestion;
- report generation;
- artifact generation.

A persistent queue, Redis, Celery, or message broker must not be introduced
until actual workload/concurrency requirements justify one.

## Environments

### Local

- source access through the read-only synchronized OneDrive mirror;
- application services locally;
- local PostgreSQL/PostGIS through the pinned Docker Compose service;
- a separate disposable PostgreSQL/PostGIS service for destructive tests;
- no dependency on production infrastructure for normal development.

### Staging

Introduce only when integration/deployment testing requires a shared
environment.

Do not copy unrestricted private production data into staging.

### Production

Managed cloud services, isolated credentials, explicit database migrations,
backups, monitoring, and access controls.

## Non-goals for V1

Do not introduce by default:

- Kubernetes;
- microservices;
- Redis;
- Celery;
- Kafka/RabbitMQ;
- multiple production PostgreSQL servers;
- self-managed PostgreSQL on a VPS;
- automatic destructive source synchronization;
- infrastructure complexity solely for hypothetical future scale.
