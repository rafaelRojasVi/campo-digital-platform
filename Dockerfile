# Campo Digital API — Transelec production container.
#
# One container serves both the JSON API (/transelec, /api/transelec) and
# the built React dashboard from the same origin (see
# apps/api/app/dashboard_static.py) — no separate frontend origin, no CORS
# surface. See docs/platform/production-platform-v1.md for the target
# production architecture (Cloud Run) and
# docs/platform/environments-and-costs.md for cost context.
#
# This packages the SAME shared FastAPI modular monolith (apps/api/app/
# main.py) LiDAR and the platform ingestion API already run — it adds no
# Transelec-specific backend behavior beyond mounting the built dashboard
# and the /api/* routing alias every browser bundle on this platform already
# expects (see app.main). Auth is the platform's real session/CSRF/RBAC
# stack; dev-only auth stays gated to APP_ENV=development exactly as it is
# everywhere else this app runs (see app.main._resolve_app_env and
# apps/api/tests/test_main_dev_auth_gate.py).
#
# Adapted from the SHAPE of feat/transelec-hosted-pilot-v1's Dockerfile
# (superseded prior art — "PR #47" in
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-transelec-hosted-pilot-v2-design.md),
# not copied: that draft predates this branch's real session/CSRF/RBAC work
# and its own CAMPO_TRANSELEC_ADMIN_TOKEN model, both superseded here. This
# image also does not bundle a Cloud Storage SDK layer — this codebase's
# app.object_store has no GCS backend yet, so that would be speculative
# runtime weight with no code path to use it.
